# Random Student Selector

## What this app does

This app helps a teacher pick students at random from a class list. You choose a class and set a timer, then press Start. The app spins through names, stops on one student, and shows the result clearly on screen. After a student is picked, you can give a quick grade (A*, A, B, or C). The app then shows a short feedback message and moves on to the next student until everyone has been chosen.

In short: it is a classroom-friendly way to call on students fairly and keep simple participation notes.
